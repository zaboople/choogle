Choogle?

Choogle is internet for chickens.

What?

No, really, our market research and focus groups tell us chickens *like* the internet, but they think it's not very chicken-friendly. Choogle intends to change that.

How is that coming along, then?

Well, we got kind of side-tracked, because internet for chickens is actually a rather ambitious project. We did make a rather nifty web crawler, one that can be very efficient with its use of memory & CPU, because our venture capitalists don't have a lot of money to put into this, because they're chickens. Visionary, innovation-oriented chickens, mind you, but still chickens.

We also realized we need to answer some questions:

How much memory should my java application use?
How long should it take to boot? Bind to a port? Start a database connection pool?
Will non-blocking I/O make my application super-duper-high-performance? Will it be sexy? Will it get me dates and party invitations?
Is non-blocking I/O hard? Is it really hard? Is it really, really hard?
Is blocking I/O pathetically slow and old-fashioned to the point that teenage dropout employees at startup companies will point at me and laugh, then tell me it's time to retire and see if they're hiring greeters at QuickieBurger? (QuickieBurger is equal opportunity & chicken-friendly, including LGBT chickens)
How much of what I read on the internet is remotely true?
Are the open source folks who write tools for us decent, selfish and noble defenders of freedom, or greedy, self-absorbed misanthropes like the rest of us?

Research into all of these questions is ongoing, and choogle has become the vehicle for such.
