Q: Choogle?

A: Choogle is internet for chickens.

Q: What?

A: No, really, our market research and focus groups tell us chickens *like* the internet, but they think it's not very chicken-friendly. Choogle intends to change that.

Q: How is that coming along, then?

A: Well, we got kind of side-tracked, because internet for chickens is actually an ambitious project. We did make a rather nifty web crawler, one that can be very efficient with its use of memory & CPU, because our venture capitalists don't have a lot of money to put into this, because they're chickens - visionary, innovation-oriented chickens, mind you, but still chickens.
