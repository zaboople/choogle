Q: Choogle?

A: Choogle is internet for chickens.

Q: What?

A: No, really, our market research and focus groups tell us chickens *like* the internet, but they think it's not very chicken-friendly. Choogle intends to change that.

Q: How is that coming along, then?

A: Well, we got kind of side-tracked, because internet for chickens is actually an ambitious project. We did make a rather nifty web crawler, one that can be very efficient with its use of memory & CPU, because our venture capitalists don't have a lot of money to put into this, because they're chickens - visionary, innovation-oriented chickens, mind you, but still chickens.

We also realized we need to answer some questions:

How much memory should my java application use?
How long should it take to boot? Bind to a port? Start a database connection pool?
Will non-blocking I/O make my application super-duper-high-performance? Will it be sexy? Will it get me dates and party invitations?
Is non-blocking I/O hard? Is it really hard? Is it really, really hard?
Is blocking I/O pathetically slow and old-fashioned to the point that teenage dropout employees at startup companies will point at me and laugh, then tell me it's time to retire and see if they're hiring greeters at QuickieBurger? (QuickieBurger is equal opportunity & chicken-friendly, including LGBT chickens)
How much of what I read on the internet is remotely true? Are the open source folks who write tools for us decent, selfish and noble defenders of freedom, or greedy, self-absorbed misanthropes like the rest of us?

These are all silly questions. The smart ones among us already know the answers... Well, rather, we _think_ we know, because we read a blog, or someone smart told us so, or we have really good intuition, or we worked it out on paper. None of that is science.

A lot of us think computer science is a math problem. Math is great; also, math is not science. Math defines the borders of what is possible, but it does not tell us what actually happened or will happen. Science is: Phenomenon, Hypothesis, Experiment, Conclusion. You don't have to be any good at math to do it. Instead, you have to be very careful and attentive to details. You have to be good at doubt: Did my experiment succeed because I cheated? Did it fail because I screwed it up? There is always a mathematical explanation, but it's the math you forgot to do.

Anyhow, choogle has become a vehicle for us to investigate our questions.

Q: Do you have any answers to any of these questions?
A: Yes and they're complicated.
